# GWAS-workshop

In the summer of 2021 our team designed and offered this (online) workshop to 17 senior high school students from the University of Toronto Schools (UTS) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, selected based on their interests and readiness in statistics, genetics or computing. Throughout the 4.5-day workshop, the mornings were used for lectures, providing the necessary background in genetics and statistics. The afternoons were guided tutorials, providing hands-on experience.
